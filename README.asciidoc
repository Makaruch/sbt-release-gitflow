== Warning
Please note, I don't like, recommend or use gitflow outside my current job. It's dogmatic and will unnecessarily complicate your code base. If you have a choice, do something, anything other than gitflow. I only created this plugin because the current SBT gitflow plugin is woefully out of date. I needed to bring some sanity to my daily grind. "Abandon all hope ye who enter here"

Based on https://github.com/sbt/sbt-release

== Add to your project
Create (or add to) project/plugins.sbt:
[source,sbt,numbered]
----
addSbtPlugin("org.lancegatlin" % "sbt-release-gitflow" % "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT")
----
Add a new file, version.sbt in the root directory of your project:
[source,sbt,numbered]
----
version in ThisBuild := "X.Y.Z-SNAPSHOT"
----
(Replace X,Y,Z above with your own versions)

== Commands
=== Create a new release
==== Command: releaseCreate
==== Overview:

. Create a new gitflow release branch (release/X.Y.Z) 
.. Note: release branch version will be the same as develop
. Advance the version number of the develop branch '-SNAPSHOT' version
. Push everything to origin
. Compile, test and publish the develop branch with the new version number
. Checkout the release branch
. Compile, test and publish the release branch

==== Command Options
* with-defaults
** Don't prompt for options, always pick the default. Used this when running in automation scripts.
* dry-run
** Don't actually do anything, but emit the git commands that will be fired
* skip-tests
** Don't run tests
* skip-publish
** Don't publish
* skip-if-exists
** Normally a fatal error occurrs if a release branch already exists. If this is set, checkout existing release branch and compile, test and publish it
* skip-push
** Don't push changes to origin

=== Close release
==== Command: releaseClose
Note1: all fixes should be committed to the release branch prior to running this command
Note2: all '-SNAPSHOT' dependencies must be manually removed from the SBT project prior to running this command

==== Overview
. Ensure no '-SNAPSHOT' dependencies are present in the SBT project
. Compile and test the project
. Remove '-SNAPSHOT' from version in version.sbt, commits change
. Merge release branch into master branch
. Tag commit 'vX.Y.Z'
. Push everything to origin
. Publish release now on master branch

==== Command Options
* with-defaults
** Don't prompt for options, always pick the default. Used this when running in automation scripts.
* dry-run
** Don't actually do anything, but emit the git commands that will be fired
* skip-tests
** Don't run tests
* skip-publish
** Don't publish
* skip-push
** Don't push changes to origin

=== Abort release
==== Command: releaseAbort
==== Overview
. Find open release branch
. Delete the branch locally and remotely

==== Command Options
* with-defaults
** Don't prompt for options, always pick the default. Used this when running in automation scripts.
* dry-run
** Don't actually do anything, but emit the git commands that will be fired
* skip-push
** Don't push changes to origin

== Build options
These build options may be set in build.sbt (or other project Scala file):

* releaseVersionBump
** An instance of Bump trait that determines how a version string is incremented. Defaults to X.Y+1.Z
* releaseCalcTagComment
** A function that computes the git tag comment for a release version. Defaults to vX.Y.Z.
* releaseCalcVersionChangeCommitMessage
** A function that computes the git commit message for the release close commit. Defaults to 'Setting version to X.Y.Z'
* releaseVersionFile
** The file to write the version to. Defaults to version.sbt
* calcGitflowReleaseBranchName
** A function to compute the name of a release branch from the current version. Defaults to 'release/X.Y.Z'
